**bytes** is a set of tools to cover many all-day tasks in iOS development.

## Get started
### Install via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)
Add the bytes Pod
```ruby
pod 'bytes'
```

## Usage
Please read the documentation to find out about all the existing bytes.

## Developing

### Implementing your own byte
Please start a discussion about a byte before implementing one of your own. We love to discuss new ideas and get a concept straigt early on.

### Testing
Please ensure proper testing of all your code whilst not blindly watching the coverage percentage.

### Documentation
Please add proper documentation to your code (Xcode Editor -> Structure -> Add Documentation). We use [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) to generate the docset. Use the `jazzy` command to generate it on your own machine.
